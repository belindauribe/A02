# A02 Git/GitHub Tutorial
## 1.) Install Git as a local program. Use the link https://git-scm.com/downloads. 
##       It gives you a version for whichever you're using Windows, Mac, Linux etc.  
##       This is a open source distributed version control system. 
##       It allows you to keep track of files and manage changes over time.

## 2.)  Create a Github Account: https://github.coms. 
##       GitHub is a Git Server that hosts your Git projects.
## 3.) Install Webstorm from JetBrains https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/. 
#        Register with your school email.
## 4.) Once downloaded, go to settings on Webstorm. Click the top right corner, and hit the tool box to Settings.
#       Go to Verison Control, then click on Git. 
#       Install the path, if windows it would be something like "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe)" 
#       or Mac, "/usr/bin/git"
##  5.)   Click Test and it should prompt Git executed successfully. 
#       You can now run Git commands on webstorm.
##  6.) Add GitHub Password to Webstorm. Go back to settings, click Appearance and Behavior, then click Passwords.
#            When you first push to GitHub, WebStorm will ask for your GitHub credentials. Once done, click OK.
#    7.) Go on Github and create a Repository. Hit the "+" in the top right corner. Click "Create new Repository"
#    8. Make the Repository public and add the readme file. Name this repository A02.
#    9.) Clone your GitHub repository into WebStorm. Go to VCS on Webstorm, get from Version Control and paste repo link.
#       e.g., (https://github.com/belindauribe/A02.git)
#   10.) To create files on Webstorm, go on your tabs and click file and create New. 
#           There you can choose what type of file you want to create.
#    11.)  Stage and commit your changes
#     12.) Push changes to Github. Your files will now be on Github.

# Glossary
**Branch**- a parallel version of a repository.
Clone- copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
Commit-A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
Fetch-, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. It 
allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.
GIT-
Github-an open source program for tracking changes in text files.
Merge-Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
Merge Conflict-A difference that occurs between merged branches. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.
Push-to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
Pull-Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.
Remote- the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.
Repository-the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder.
            A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.
            Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
